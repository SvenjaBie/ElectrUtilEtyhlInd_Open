The code is to be used in the following way.
1) Make sure all required packages can be loaded at the beginning of each of the scripts and that you have a solver liscense for the optimisation. Change the solver name in 'functions.py' at the required locations.
2) Make sure the piece of code you want to run is not commented out in the 'script.py' file and comment out all other parts of the code
3) The code then uses the functions in 'functions.py' to run the optimisation when running 'script.py'.
4) After having run the optimisation and collected the results in .pickle as file, use the code starting in line 384 of 'script.py' to store the results in .csv files 
5) In the 'plots.py' file, select the parts of the code you'd like to use and comment out the remaining code. Make sure the respective .pickle file with the results is stored in the same location as your code.
